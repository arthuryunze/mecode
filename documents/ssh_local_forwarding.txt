-L address
-N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just
             forwarding ports.  Refer to the description of SessionType
             in ssh_config(5) for details. 不执行远程命令
-f	Requests ssh to go to background just before command
             execution.  This is useful if ssh is going to ask for
             passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the
             background.  This implies -n.  The recommended way to start
             X11 programs at a remote site is with something like ssh -f
             host xterm.

             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to
             “yes”, then a client started with -f will wait for all
             remote port forwards to be successfully established before
             placing itself in the background.  Refer to the description
             of ForkAfterAuthentication in ssh_config(5) for details.后台执行转发
